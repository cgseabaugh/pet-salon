room for our family to grow. I'm furious at both my family and myself, because we saw this all coming from a mile away and you told me over and over and
I still didn't listen. I feel deeply betrayed by them all, and I'm especially struggling with all of this because I'm becoming really familiar with my
flaws and I'm really afraid that I can't change them and they'll chase you away. I've always been accustomed to being lonely, but the benefit was that
there wasn't anyone to point out where I was going wrong or demand anything different from me. You're the only one who's cared enough to do that. It's like
pulling teeth to get myself to open up to you at all, it literally takes us getting into these big fights for me to finally surrender my stupid fucking ego
and talk to you. That's not your fault, god knows you try. You're right about the problems I've inherited from my parents, I think that's one of them.
I've never confided in either of them. But I'm really not trying to make excuses for myself. I know I have to be better. At the very least, I can't let 
the pain and misery that I've already put you through be in vain.
